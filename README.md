Hi, I'm Ethan Tucker! I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing an M.S. in Data Science. I graduated from Kalamazoo College with a
double major in mathematics and physics, where I discovered a love of facts-based decisions. I completed my SIP (senior thesis) in data analysis. A copy of my SIP can be found
on my GitHub at https://github.com/firstrider55/Research - be wary it's pretty long! When given the choice I tend to work in R, primarily using the tidyverse. I am an avid
paraglider and rock climber, and love all things outdoors. I can be reached at ettu1478@colorado.edu for buisness inquiries, or if you have a cool data set for me to look at!
