Hi, I'm Ethan Tucker! I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing an M.S. in Data Science. I graduated from Kalamazoo College with a double major in mathematics and physics, where I discovered a love of facts-based decisions. I completed my SIP (senior thesis) in data analysis. The GitHub repo containing my SIP is https://github.com/EthanJTucker/Research. The PDF output can be found at https://github.com/EthanJTucker/Research/blob/be9214f9457ba7b9582fffcf8b6306cba1135785/SIP_Report.pdf. My favorite languages for Data Science are Python and R, particularly using the tidyverse suite. I am an avid paraglider and rock climber, and love all things outdoors. I can be reached at Ethan.Tucker@colorado.edu for business inquiries, or if you have a cool data set for me to look at!
